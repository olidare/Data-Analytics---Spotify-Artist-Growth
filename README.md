# Data-Analytics---Spotify-Artist-Growth

### Project Overview <img src="Data/ramona1.jpeg"  align=right>


This data analytics initiative aims to help Colombian singer 'La Ramona' significantly increase her Spotify streaming presence through comprehensive analysis of her listener data, streaming patterns, and audience demographics. 


While La Ramona has built a notable Instagram following, this project will focus on understanding her Spotify ecosystem and developing targeted strategies for streaming growth.




#### Core Objectives

- Conduct in-depth analysis of La Ramona's Spotify streaming metrics: geographical distribution, listener demographics, and playlist inclusion.
- Identify key patterns in listener behavior and content performance across her catalog.
- Understand the impact Instagram has on Spotify performance.
- Create data-driven recommendations for strategic content releases and promotion.
- Understand what causes increases in Streams.

#### Multi-Channel Approach

We'll explore multiple growth avenues including, but not limited to:

- Spotify-native growth strategies (playlists, collaborations, release timing)
- Strategic leveraging of her existing Instagram audience as one potential conversion channel
- Identifying untapped audience segments based on similar artist analysis
- Optimizing streaming performance based on platform-specific algorithms and listener habits

#### Expected Outcomes

This project will deliver actionable insights that enable La Ramona to make informed decisions about her music strategy, marketing initiatives, and content creation. By deeply understanding her Spotify audience and streaming patterns, we'll create a comprehensive growth roadmap backed by data, helping her build sustainable streaming success while maintaining her authentic Colombian artistic voice.

### Plan Stage

**How will we gather data?**

- We have access to `Spotify for Artists` where we can download Streaming, Audience & Playlist details.
- We will also use Spotify's API for further insights into Tracks and Audience behaviour.
- Furthermore, we will connect the Instagram API to also monitor the impact social media has on Spotify performance.

**Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis**

- We shall compile and clean the data, the, conduct exploratory analysis to get a better pciture of the data we have, to help guide us where to conduct deeper statistical analysis and which  hypothesises to test.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

In this Notebook we will import the Spotify .csvs, from here we will get a better understanding of the data:

- Popular Tracks
- Timeline of Stream history.
- Timeline of Follower history.
- Discover the Geographic distribution of Tracks.
- Peak Streaming days.

### **Advanced Data Analysis**

Once we have established a solid base understanding of the Spotify Streams, we will then use Spotify & Instagram API data to dive deeper.

- Analyze audio characteristics of top tracks and find similar artists.
- Identify playlists containing songs with comparable structure and musical elements, including rhythm, pitch, and timbre.
- Quantify Instagram post impact on streaming numbers.
- Map audience preferences and listening habits.

### **Advanced Statistics:**

#### Regression Model: Quantifying Impact Factors
A multiple linear regression (or logistic regression for binary outcomes) can help you determine which factors most influence stream growth.

Example Model:

 | Factor Type          | Example Metrics                          | Data Source                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Song Characteristics** | Danceability, Energy, Valence, Duration | Spotify API (`audio_features`)  |
| **Social Media**     | TikTok shares, Instagram Reels views     | Instagram/TikTok APIs or manual |
| **Promotion**        | Playlist adds, PR campaigns              | Spotify for Artists CSV         |
| **Temporal**         | Release day, seasonality                 | Custom date features            |

#### Time-Series Analysis
Model how streams evolve post-release using:

ARIMA or Prophet to forecast trends.
Event studies: Measure impact of promotions (e.g., spikes after TikTok posts).

#### A/B Testing
**Hypothesis:** "Shorter songs (<2.5 mins) gain more streams."
**Method:** Compare streams of shortened vs. original tracks.

#### Principal component analysis (PCA)
Conduct PCA on all the features of each of the songs (Acousticness, danceability, energy, duration, instrumentals, valence, popularity, tempo, and speechines) and find the features of the songs that group well together. - Use these to find good collaborations.

#### Sentiment Analysis (Social Media)
Use NLP on fan comments (Instagram/TikTok) to:
Gauge song reception (positive/negative).
Correlate sentiment with stream retention.

#### Clustering for Audience Segmentation
Group listeners by behavior (e.g., demographics, streaming patterns) using:
k-Means or DBSCAN on:
    Streaming frequency
    Geographic location
    Playlist interactions
**Actionable Insight:**
Target high-value clusters with tailored ads.


### **Growth Strategy**

Once Analysis has concluded, we can take a data-driven apporach to the Spotify Growth Strategy.

- Create strategic public playlists combining original content with complementary tracks.
- Target compatible playlist curators for placement opportunities.
- Target Audience 
- Performing in places where there is good followings.
- The better use of Instagram to grow Streams.
