### **Advanced Data Analysis**

Once we have established a solid base understanding of the Spotify Streams, we will then use Spotify & Instagram API data to dive deeper.

- Identify playlists containing songs with comparable structure and musical elements, including rhythm, pitch, and timbre.
- Quantify Instagram post impact on streaming numbers.
